# RestInSourceCode (RISC)
A memorial site for OpenSource Devs who have passed. Passed but never forgotten.

All the Open Source community is invited to add all those great open source devs here. Those who spent their life serving the commuinity of developers and non-developers. Initally, I am adding only a single Open Source Developer as template. You are welcomed to create new issue based on template provided to add more and more of those amazing people here.

## Note:
This repository is based on the idea of [Rob Fuller](https://github.com/mubix)'s [RestInCode](https://github.com/mubix/restincode)
